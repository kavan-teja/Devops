## Understanding 'On Premise' Provisioning

On-premise provisioning refers to the process of setting up and managing IT infrastructure within an organization's physical premises or data centers.

> 💡 **Modern Perspective**: While cloud computing is popular, on-premise solutions are still crucial for industries with strict data regulations or specific performance requirements.

---

## What is On Premise?

"On-premise" (sometimes written as "on-premises") refers to the installation and running of software and hardware on computers physically located within the organization's premises, rather than at a remote facility or in the cloud.

Key characteristics:
- Physical control over hardware
- Direct access to infrastructure
- Customizable security measures
- Potentially higher initial costs

> 🏢 **Trend**: Hybrid models combining on-premise and cloud solutions are becoming increasingly popular, offering flexibility and resilience.

---

## Provisioning Infrastructure

Provisioning infrastructure in an on-premise environment involves:

1. **Hardware Acquisition**: Purchasing and installing physical servers, networking equipment, and storage devices.
2. **Network Setup**: Configuring LAN, WAN, and security measures.
3. **Software Installation**: OS, middleware, and application deployment.
4. **Resource Allocation**: Assigning compute, storage, and network resources to different applications and services.

> 🤖 **Innovation**: Explore software-defined infrastructure (SDI) to bring cloud-like flexibility to on-premise setups.

---

## Server Templating

Server templating is the process of creating a standardized server configuration that can be easily replicated. It's crucial for maintaining consistency across multiple server instances.

Benefits:
- Faster deployment
- Reduced configuration errors
- Easier maintenance and updates

> 🧬 **Modern Approach**: Consider using infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform or Ansible to define your server templates.

---

## Connectivity with Servers

Connectivity refers to the methods and protocols used to communicate with and manage servers. Common methods include:

- SSH (Secure Shell)
- RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
- VPN (Virtual Private Network)

> 🔒 **Security Tip**: Implement zero-trust network access (ZTNA) principles for more secure server connectivity.

---

## What is a Client?

In the context of networking and server-client architecture:

A client is a computer hardware device or software that accesses a service made available by a server. The client can be:

1. **Hardware**: Personal computers, smartphones, IoT devices
2. **Software**: Web browsers, email clients, mobile apps

> 📱 **Modern Trend**: With the rise of edge computing, clients are becoming more powerful and capable of handling complex tasks locally.

---

## What is Templating?

Templating is the process of creating a predefined format or structure that can be reused multiple times. In IT, templating is used in various contexts:

1. Server configuration
2. Network setup
3. Application deployment
4. User interface design

> 🎨 **Innovation**: Look into "living templates" that automatically update based on real-time data or best practices.

---

## Server Side Templating

Server-side templating involves generating the final output (usually HTML) on the server before sending it to the client. The server processes the template, fills in the dynamic data, and sends the complete page to the client.

Popular server-side templating engines:
- Jinja2 (Python)
- EJS (Node.js)
- ERB (Ruby)

### Challenges of Server Side Templating

1. **Server Load**: Can increase server resource usage, especially for high-traffic sites.
2. **Scalability**: May require more server resources as traffic grows.
3. **Page Load Time**: Full page reloads can lead to slower perceived performance.

### Advantages of Server Side Templating

1. **SEO Friendly**: Search engines can easily crawl fully rendered pages.
2. **Initial Page Load**: Faster initial page load as content is pre-rendered.
3. **Consistency**: Ensures uniform rendering across different clients.

> 🚀 **Performance Tip**: Consider implementing server-side rendering (SSR) with hydration for the best of both worlds - fast initial loads and dynamic interactivity.

## Server Side Templating vs Client Side Templating

| Aspect | Server Side Templating | Client Side Templating |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Rendering Location | Server | Browser |
| Initial Load | Typically faster | May be slower |
| Subsequent Loads | Full page reload | Partial updates possible |
| SEO | Generally better | Can be challenging |
| Server Load | Higher | Lower |
| Interactivity | Limited without additional JS | Highly interactive |

> 🔀 **Hybrid Approach**: Many modern frameworks (e.g., Next.js, Nuxt.js) offer both server-side and client-side rendering capabilities.

---

## Practical Exercises

1. Set up a basic on-premise server using virtualization software like VirtualBox.
2. Create a server template using Packer and provision it with Ansible.
3. Implement a simple server-side templating system using a language of your choice.
