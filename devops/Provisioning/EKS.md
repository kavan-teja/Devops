# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Tutorial
## Introduction

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of EKS, helping you understand its core concepts and how to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with EKS, ensure you have:

- An AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured on your local machine
- kubectl (Kubernetes command-line tool) installed
- eksctl installed (a simple CLI tool for creating and managing clusters on EKS)
- Basic knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes concepts

## Key Concepts

Understanding these key concepts is crucial for working with EKS:

- **Cluster**: A set of EC2 instances running containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.
- **Node Group**: A group of EC2 instances of the same instance type that serve as worker nodes in your cluster.
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers.
- **Service**: An abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy to access them.
- **Fargate Profile**: Allows you to run pods on AWS Fargate, a serverless compute engine for containers.

## Setting Up EKS

Follow these steps to set up an EKS cluster:

1. Configure AWS CLI:
   ```
   aws configure
   ```

2. Create an EKS cluster using eksctl:
   ```
   eksctl create cluster --name my-cluster --region us-west-2 --node-type t2.micro --nodes 2
   ```

3. Verify the cluster creation:
   ```
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

## Deploying an Application

Let's deploy a simple application to your EKS cluster:

1. Create a deployment YAML file (e.g., `deployment.yaml`):
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: nginx-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: nginx
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: nginx
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: nginx
           image: nginx:1.14.2
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

2. Apply the deployment:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

3. Expose the deployment as a service:
   ```
   kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --port=80
   ```

4. Check the service status:
   ```
   kubectl get services
   ```

## Scaling and Updating

To scale your application:

```
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=5
```

To update your application:

1. Edit the deployment YAML file, changing the image version.
2. Apply the changes:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

## Monitoring and Logging

EKS integrates with various AWS services for monitoring and logging:

1. Enable Container Insights:
   ```
   eksctl utils update-cluster-logging --enable-types all --region us-west-2 --cluster my-cluster
   ```

2. Use CloudWatch to view logs and metrics.

3. For more detailed monitoring, consider using Prometheus and Grafana.

## Best Practices

- Use IAM roles for service accounts to manage pod-level permissions
- Implement proper resource requests and limits
- Regularly update your EKS cluster and applications
- Use AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for managing secrets
- Implement proper network policies using AWS VPC CNI
- Use AWS CodePipeline or Jenkins for CI/CD

## Conclusion

This tutorial covered the basics of Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. As you progress, explore more advanced topics like persistent storage with EBS, ALB Ingress Controller, and Fargate profiles. EKS provides a robust platform for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale on AWS.

Remember to clean up resources when you're done experimenting to avoid unnecessary costs:

```
eksctl delete cluster --name my-cluster --region us-west-2
```

Happy learning and deploying with EKS!
