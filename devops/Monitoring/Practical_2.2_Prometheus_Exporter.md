|----------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Prometheus** | Monitoring and alerting toolkit        | Used for system and service monitoring| Typically installed on a dedicated server | Collects metrics from configured endpoints| Data Collector, Data Processor          |
| **Grafana**    | Data visualization and dashboard tool  | Used for visualizing data from various sources| Installed on a server or local machine   | Does not collect data itself; connects to data sources| Data Displayer                           |
| **Node Exporter** | Exposes machine metrics for Prometheus | Used to gather hardware and OS metrics| Installed on each system to be monitored | Collects system metrics (CPU, memory, etc.)| Data Collector                           |
| **Nagios**     | System and network monitoring          | Used for monitoring system and network health| Installed on a server                    | Collects and monitors data from hosts and services| Data Collector, Data Processor, Notifier|

## Detailed Explanation

### Prometheus
- **Purpose:** Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- **Where & Why It's Used:** It's used to monitor systems and services by collecting and storing their metrics. It's popular for its powerful query language and alerting capabilities.
- **Installation Location:** Typically installed on a dedicated monitoring server.
- **Data Collection:** Prometheus scrapes (collects) metrics from configured endpoints, such as Node Exporter, application instrumentation, etc.
- **Role:** Acts as a data collector and processor. It collects metrics data, processes it, and allows querying using PromQL.

### Grafana
- **Purpose:** Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability, primarily used for visualizing time-series data.
- **Where & Why It's Used:** It's used for creating dashboards to visualize metrics and logs from various data sources like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, etc.
- **Installation Location:** Installed on a server or a local machine where dashboards need to be accessed.
- **Data Collection:** Grafana does not collect data itself. It connects to existing data sources (like Prometheus) to display data.
- **Role:** Acts as a data displayer. It reads from data sources and visualizes the data through customizable dashboards.

### Node Exporter
- **Purpose:** Node Exporter is an exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by *nix kernels, for consumption by Prometheus.
- **Where & Why It's Used:** It's used to gather metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, etc., from a machine.
- **Installation Location:** Installed on each system that needs to be monitored.
- **Data Collection:** Collects system metrics and exposes them to be scraped by Prometheus.
- **Role:** Acts as a data collector, specifically for hardware and OS metrics.

### Nagios
- **Purpose:** Nagios is an open-source monitoring tool for checking the health of systems, networks, and infrastructure.
- **Where & Why It's Used:** It's used to monitor the health and performance of systems, networks, and applications. It provides alerts when things go wrong and when they get better.
- **Installation Location:** Installed on a central server that monitors various hosts and services.
- **Data Collection:** Collects data from hosts and services using plugins. Monitors parameters like uptime, disk usage, memory usage, etc.
- **Role:** Acts as a data collector, processor, and notifier. It collects data, processes it to check against predefined thresholds, and sends notifications based on the health status.
